# rp_c18_updated
This was an old project from 2018 where we attempted to improve rp_c18 for Divinity Roleplay.
As much as we loved this version of rp_c18 it never worked out and was never put on the server.
Now its open source for anyone to use

The assets for the map are located in rp_c18_updated_assets.rar
They are freshly extracted from the recent version on the workshop.
